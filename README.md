# Neural Network for digits recognition

This NN has been trained with the [MNIST](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/mnist) data set, using 28x28 pixel images.

# How to Run

Just run the `main.py` script.
Feel free to uncomment the `model = tf.keras.models.load_model('handwritten.model')` line and comment the code above it to not create and train the NN every time.
